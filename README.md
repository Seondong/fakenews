This repository is to save the footprint of my solution of fake news classification task, which is one of the three tasks in WSDM Cup 2019.

I spent one week on this project, and my final submission scores on the 23rd position.

Our solution is a simple blending of diverse pretrained BERT models.

Please follow the notebook files, BTW I deleted a huge portion of intermediary files.
